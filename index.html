      <h4><b>Here's a time line of Stephen Hawking:</b></h4>
    <ul style="font-family:courier;">
      <li><b><u>1942</u></b> - Stephen Hawking is born in Oxford, England.</li>
      <li><b><u>1959</u></b> - At only 17 years old, Hawking begins studying physics at Oxford University. Finding the work quite easy, Hawking studies very little. During his last year of study, Hawking becomes increasingly clumsy.</li>
      <li><b><u>1962</u></b> - After receiving a first-class honors degree in natural science from Oxford, Hawking starts his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge.</li>   
      <li><b><u>1963</u></b> - While attending a party, Hawking meets Jane Wilde, a languages undergraduate and later on he just shy of his 21st birthday, Hawking is diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) – a rare disease that affects movement and speech. He is told he is only likely to live for two more years.</li>
      <li><b><u>1965</u></b> - Jane and Stephen marry. They have three children together.After that Hawking writes his thesis based on applying Roger Penrose's theory of space-time singularity.</li>
      <li><b><u>1966</u></b> - Hawking completes his doctorate and is awarded a fellowship at Gonville and Caius Collage, Cambridge.The Hawking's essay Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time wins him the Adams Prize. </li>
      <li><b><u>1968</u></b> - At Cambridge, Hawking becomes a member of the Institute of Astronomy.</li>
      <li><b><u>1969</u></b> - As Hawking's health worsens, he begins to use crutches before eventually being forced to use a wheelchair.</li>
      <li><b><u>1970</u></b> - Hawking discovers The Second Law of Black Hole Dynamics. Using quantum theory and general relativity, Hawking reveals that black holes can emit radiation. </li>
      <li><b><u>1973</u></b> - The highly technical The Large Structure of Space-Time is published by Hawking, and marks his first published book. </li>
      <li><b><u>1975</u></b> - Pope Paul VI awards Hawking the Pius XI Gold Medal for Science.</li>
      <li><b><u>1977</u></b> - Hawking is appointed as professor of gravitational physics at Cambridge.</li>
      <li><b><u>1978</u></b> - The University of Oxford awards Hawking an honorary doctorate.</li>
      <li><b><u>1979</u></b> - Upon returning to Cambridge, Hawking is awarded one of the teaching’s most renowned posts, as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, which has only been held by 14 people since 1663 – including Sir Isaac Newton.</li>
      <li><b><u>1982</u></b> - The Queen awards Hawking a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire).</li>
      <li><b><u>1985</u></b> - While in Geneva, Hawking catches pneumonia. Following a tracheotomy, Hawking loses his voice. His speech had become increasingly slurred before the surgical procedure. A computer programmer created a speech synthesizing program for Hawking to communicate with.</li>
      <li><b><u>1988</u></b> - Hawking's most famous book, A Brief History of Time, is published. He began working on the book in 1982. It sells 10 million copies and is translated into 40 languages, skyrocketing to the top of the bestseller lists in the US and UK.</li>
      <li><b><u>1989</u></b> - Hawking is appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour.</li>
      <li><b><u>1993</u></b> - Steven Spielberg produces a documentary about Hawking's life titled A Brief History of Time. Hawking also appears as himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation.</li>
      <li><b><u>1995</u></b> - After separating in 1990, Hawking and Jane divorce. Not long after, Hawking marries Elaine Mason, a nurse who he had fallen in love with.</li>
      <li><b><u>1997</u></b> - A six part mini-series premiers on TV called Stephen Hawking’s Universe.</li>
      <li><b><u>2001</u></b> - Hawking publishes another book, The Universe in a Nutshell, which wins the Aventis Prizes for Science Books.</li>
      <li><b><u>2004</u></b> - Announcing that he has solved the Black Hole paradox, Hawking presents his recent findings at the international conference on general relativity and gravitation in Dublin.</li>
      <li><b><u>2005</u></b> - Hawking publishes a new book titled A Briefer History of Time, an update and re-write of his previous book "A Brief History in Time" and also Hawking begins to control his communication device with the muscles in his cheek.  </li>
      <li><b><u>2006</u></b> - Hawking and his then-wife Elaine file for a divorce and Hawking becomes closer to his children.</li>
      <li><b><u>2007</u></b> - Hawking becomes the first quadriplegic to aboard a zero gravity flight. He experiences weightlessness eight times and performs some acrobatic maneuvers after that Hawking and his daughter Lucy publish George's Secret Key to the Universe. It is a children's sci-fi novel that explains the basics of theoretical physics.</li>
      <li><b><u>2009</u></b> - Hawking fails to appear at a conference in Arizona owing to a chest infection. He can no longer drive his wheelchair independently and experiences increasing respiratory problems. Hawking becomes the Director of Research at the Institute for Theoretical Cosmology at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at Cambridge University. Hawking also receives America's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, from President Barack Obama. After 30 years, Hawking steps down from his position as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. </li>
      <li><b><u>2010</u></b> - Hawking publishes The Grand Design, arguing against the idea that God created the universe.</li>
      <li><b><u>2011</u></b> - Wishing to encourage future research in the area of ALS, Hawking participates in a trial of a new headband-styled device called the iBrain. The device is designed to read the wearer's thoughts.</li>
      <li><b><u>2012</u></b> - Hawking is awarded the Fundamental Physics Prize, winning $3 million for his theory on the ability for black holes to emit energy.</li>
      <li><b>2014</u></b> - Among other top scientists, Hawking warns about the dangers of artificial intelligence. A film about the life of Hawking and Jane Wilde is released, staring Eddie Redmayne as Hawking. </li>
      <li><b><u>2015</u></b> - Speaking at a press conference in London, Hawking announces a new project with billionaire Yuri Milner to search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</li>
      <li><b><u>2018</u></b> - Hawking's family confirmed he had died peacefully.</li>

And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.”</em></p>
